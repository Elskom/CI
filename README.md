## Welcome to Elskom/CI

A Github CI that checks for news entries for [Els_kom](https://github.com/Elskom/Els_kom_new), and possibly other things.

# Running

Install some ruby package for envionment variable management that I do not remember  and create a file creating and setting the "MY_PERSONAL_TOKEN" environment variable.

Then run "ruby CI.rb" (I do not exactly remember the command either).
